# NFL Schedule Generator

This Python project generates a simplified NFL schedule for 32 teams.

## Features

- Creates 32 NFL teams with conferences and divisions
- Generates a 17-week schedule
- Allows viewing the full schedule or a specific team's schedule

## Usage

Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

## Note

This is a simplified version of NFL scheduling. The actual NFL schedule is much more complex, taking into account various factors such as:

- Divisional games
- Inter-conference and intra-conference games
- Prime time and holiday games
- Travel distances
- Bye weeks
- And many more factors

To create a more realistic NFL schedule generator, you would need to implement these additional rules and constraints.
